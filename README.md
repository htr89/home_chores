# home_chores

Deal with your own chores with a point based system.

This repository now includes a minimal [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) setup with a small Express backend.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):

```bash
npm install
```

To run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start an Express server on `http://localhost:3000` to store tasks in a local JSON file.
